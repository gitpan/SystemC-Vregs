* Changes in Vregs 1.200 11/26/2001

**	Allow replacement of enumeration before/after rules.

***	Fixed bug where enumerations in registers would cause wrong
	reset value in _info.cpp

***	Made sizes in vregs_info be a 64 bit integer.

**	Added macros for compile-time hooks to add debugging checks, listed
	below.  See them in include/VregsClass.h.

***	Define VREGS_ENUM_DEF_INITTER(badValue) to make the default ctor
	for enum-classes initialize the enum.  Otherwise it's undefined.

***	Define VREGS_SETFIELD_CHK(str,val,u_max) to validate the argument
	before stuffing it into struct.field "str".  Otherwise Vregs classes
	silently truncate the argument.

***	Define VREGS_STRUCT_DEF_CTOR(TypeName, numWords) if you want structs
	to have a default contructor, e.g. to initialize the words to
	0xdeadbeef.  Otherwise Vregs structs are initially undefined (just
	like a C++ array of uint32_t).

****	Changed enumeration ascii() default to "?E" instead of "%E"

* Changes in Vregs 1.100 10/18/2001

**	Added rules for .cpp files: before_enum_cpp,
	after_enum_cpp, before_class_cpp, after_class_cpp.

***	Made RBASEA_ and RBASEAE_ defines from common prefix
	exising across multiple registers.  RBASEAM_ is a power-of-two
	mask for extracting that range.

***	Classes which have a smaller base class now have the
	correct sizeof(), previously they would have the base's sizeof.

***	Non-contiguous fields are now postfixed with a number instead
	of prefixed.  Thus CR1_Reg_Field and CR2_Reg_Field become
	CR_Reg_Field_1 and CR_Reg_Field_2.

***	Fields that extend beyond 32 bits now get additional defines
	with the word number enclosed in them.  This allows for easy
	extraction from 32-bit busses.

****	Comment columns in register definitions now become attributes.
	This allows other parsers to pick off the fields they need.

****	Fixed E_ enum defines to be in hex, not decimal.


* Changes in Vregs 1.000 9/03/2001

**	First publicized release.

***	Added ENUM ascii() methods to cpp instead of inlined .h


* Changes in Vregs 0.1 6/27/2001

****	Package Released as Beta
