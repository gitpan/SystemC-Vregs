* Changes in Vregs 1.100 10/18/2001

**	Added rules for .cpp files: before_enum_cpp,
	after_enum_cpp, before_class_cpp, after_class_cpp.

***	Made RBASEA_ and RBASEAE_ defines from common prefix
	exising across multiple registers.  RBASEAM_ is a power-of-two
	mask for extracting that range.

***	Classes which have a smaller base class now have the
	correct sizeof(), previously they would have the base's sizeof.

***	Non-contiguous fields are now postfixed with a number instead
	of prefixed.  Thus CR1_Reg_Field and CR2_Reg_Field become
	CR_Reg_Field_1 and CR_Reg_Field_2.

***	Fields that extend beyond 32 bits now get additional defines
	with the word number enclosed in them.  This allows for easy
	extraction from 32-bit busses.

****	Comment columns in register definitions now become attributes.
	This allows other parsers to pick off the fields they need.

****	Fixed E_ enum defines to be in hex, not decimal.
