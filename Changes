Revision history for Perl extension SystemC::Vregs

The contributors that suggested a given feature are shown in [].

* Vregs 1.301 7/27/2005 

***	Create parameters for 'define's to allow bit extraction. [Bryce Denney]

***	Fix wBitMaskWritable() with > 32 bit registers.

* Vregs 1.300 6/17/2005

**	Added vderegs program, for dumping structures.  

**	The previous _named.cpp/.h files are now part of the _info.cpp/h files.
	Any programs which used these needs to modify their include list.

***	Read attribute columns from Enum value tables.  [Larry Stewart]

***	Added Lisp to Verilog::Language formats.  [Larry Stewart]

****	Added warning when define/enum value exceeds field width.

****	Fix Latex2html documents getting mismerged register attributes.

* Vregs 1.261 5/23/2005

***	In classes, support h# and d# for 16 & 64-bit words. [Jud Leonard]

****	Add enum attribute --allowlc for lower case enums.  [Bryce Denney]

****	Fix class header packing on 64 bit architectures.  [Bryce Denney]

****	Better use of tabs in .vregs output file.

* Vregs 1.260 3/1/2005

***	With -v2k attribute, use localparam instead of parameter.

***	Add Doxygen comments to C++ sources.

* Vregs 1.250 1/13/2005

**	NEWS is now renamed Changes, to support CPAN indexing. [Offer Kaye]

***	Support Unicode decoding in Perl 5.8.0

***	Support latex2html documents.

****	Fix 64-bit compile warnings.

* Vregs 1.246 10/23/2004

***	Support Star Office documents.

* Vregs 1.245 7/22/2004

***	Add operator!= to enum classes for GCC 3.0

***	Support parsing of Netscape Composer documents.  [Reed Lawson]

* Vregs 1.244 1/27/2004

****	Documentation fixes.

* Vregs 1.243 10/30/2003

***	Add before_any_file rule.  

****	Documentation fixes.  [Mike Castle]

* Vregs 1.242 9/4/2003

**	Allow classes to have fields which are expanded from other classes.
	For an example, see "ExClass" in vregs_spec.doc. [John DeRoo]

***	Add CRESET_ defines for the default values of non-zero, non-bool fields.
	[John DeRoo]

* Vregs 1.241 6/9/2003

***	Added error if a derived class is extended to more words then its base
	class.  Use the '-stretchable' attribute on the base class to disable this.
	Also check at runtime the word set methods, unless -stretchable is used.

***	Added enum values to parameter files
	These include a enum declaration for Synopsys and the author's
	verilog-mode for emacs.  This allows the enumeration values to be
	decoded into verilog strings.  [John DeRoo]

****	With vspec --rm switch, remove MS Word change bar comments
	This enables use of wvHtml to convert MSWord doc files to html.

****	Attributes in special columns of register bits are now passed
	through into .vregs files.  [Tom Levergood]

****	Fix structs referencing structs declared later in the same package.

****	Add/drop leading 0s in define values to make correctly widthed numbers.

* Vregs 1.240 12/13/2002

**	Added subclassing of enumerations.  
	A enumeration can now reference another enumeration, and all values under the
	lower enumeration will be included in the upper enumeration.

**	Added a castHBytep() or castNBytep() method to each structure.
	For safety, use it in place of reinterpret_cast<uint8_t*>(&struct)
	to avoid endian-ness mistakes.

**	Added support for registers wider then 32 bits.

**	Renamed "vregs" executable to "vreg" to avoid Win2K conflict
	with uppercase directory by the same name.

**	Allow -descfunc attribute on enums to create a function to get description name

***	Added error when a struct of one endian-ness inherits a struct of
	opposite endian-ness.  Use "-[no]netorder" on derived type to fix it.

****	Fixed propagation of attributes across wildcarded classes.

****	Fixed decimal reset values in VregsRegInfo classes.

* Vregs 1.230 8/8/2002

**	Added --noregtest attribute to registers, for suppressing testing.

***	Added _hash.pm output file, for easy conversion of enum
	values to/from text descriptions.

***	Make m_w data storage protected.  Use w() accessors instead.

****	Warn about empty bit descriptions.

****	Added dump() methods for internal debugging.

* Vregs 1.210 3/11/2002

***	Allow duplicate enumeration values.  The ascii() method will
	print the first sorted enumeration text.

****	Fix ORing in of ranged addresses.  [Greg Waters]

* Vregs 1.200 11/26/2001

**	Allow replacement of enumeration before/after rules.

***	Fixed bug where enumerations in registers would cause wrong
	reset value in _info.cpp

***	Made sizes in vregs_info be a 64 bit integer.

**	Added macros for compile-time hooks to add debugging checks, listed
	below.  See them in include/VregsClass.h.

***	Define VREGS_ENUM_DEF_INITTER(badValue) to make the default ctor
	for enum-classes initialize the enum.  Otherwise it's undefined.

***	Define VREGS_SETFIELD_CHK(str,val,u_max) to validate the argument
	before stuffing it into struct.field "str".  Otherwise Vregs classes
	silently truncate the argument.

***	Define VREGS_STRUCT_DEF_CTOR(TypeName, numWords) if you want structs
	to have a default constructor, e.g. to initialize the words to
	0xdeadbeef.  Otherwise Vregs structs are initially undefined (just
	like a C++ array of uint32_t).

****	Changed enumeration ascii() default to "?E" instead of "%E"

* Vregs 1.100 10/18/2001

**	Added rules for .cpp files: before_enum_cpp,
	after_enum_cpp, before_class_cpp, after_class_cpp.

***	Made RBASEA_ and RBASEAE_ defines from common prefix
	exising across multiple registers.  RBASEAM_ is a power-of-two
	mask for extracting that range.

***	Classes which have a smaller base class now have the
	correct sizeof(), previously they would have the base's sizeof.

***	Non-contiguous fields are now postfixed with a number instead
	of prefixed.  Thus CR1_Reg_Field and CR2_Reg_Field become
	CR_Reg_Field_1 and CR_Reg_Field_2.

***	Fields that extend beyond 32 bits now get additional defines
	with the word number enclosed in them.  This allows for easy
	extraction from 32-bit busses.

****	Comment columns in register definitions now become attributes.
	This allows other parsers to pick off the fields they need.

****	Fixed E_ enum defines to be in hex, not decimal.

* Vregs 1.000 9/03/2001

**	First publicized release.

***	Added ENUM ascii() methods to cpp instead of inlined .h

* Vregs 0.1 6/27/2001

****	Package Released as Beta
